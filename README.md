# become-an-architect

My learning curve to become an architect.

This doesn't said I am an certificated architect yet, and as technology evolution, an certificated architect will also need to recharge.

This Document record my learn curves, which books I have read, which tech or framework I have been interested on, and how I transfrom my self from a telecommunication system design engineer into an J2EE engineer and now a FE focused fullstack engineer.
