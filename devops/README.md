# Why I want to learn devops

I want my features release to production as easy as possible

I want my product scale as easy as possible

I want to have clear boundaries and service discovery capability of my services

I want my infrastructure decouple as much as possible

I don't want to have A single point of failure (SPOF) in my product

I don't want Ops guy to touch my configurations
